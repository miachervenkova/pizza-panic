# Pizza Panic

- the goal of the game is to make as many pizzas as possible. First, you need to find all the toppings in the kitchen.


INSTRUCTIONS:
- you need a GameBoy emulator to play the game. We used Emulicious for development.
- use the d-pad to move. The START button (Return) starts the round. Use the A button (S) to add a topping and the B button (A) to remove a topping.
- the game consists of three rounds: the first one - 60 seconds, the second one - 40 seconds, and the third one - 14 seconds. 
- The last round is the shortest, and you must attempt to make at least four pizzas.
